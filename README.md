The focus of this project was to determine how beamforming algorithms and techniques can be applied to electroencephalographic measurements to optimize source detection and resolve sources with a high spatial correlation. Applying beamforming to EEG's can provide a significantly higher amount of spatial resolution than standard dipole modeling, and as a result can provide more accurate measurements and produce more meaningful data.
